The term constant in Go is used to denote fixed values
Constant variables are declared with const (i.e const a = 55)
Constant variables cannot be reassigned (like literally every other lang)
The value of a constant must be known at compile time, because of that something like (const b = math.Sqrt(4) will not work)

String constants:
Values enclosed between double quotes are string constants.
String constants are untyped
Typed string constants can be defined by 'const typedhello string = "Hello World"
